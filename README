This is my Rabbitmq-deployed-in-Docker project
This branch is about deploy WorkQueues in Docker
The docker-compose.yml file create three containers: one tasker and two works, the three
containers use the same python:3.7-alpine image, and the two workers have the same Dockerfile,
actually the app create two containers based on one Dockerfile:

worker folder ____build____-> worker image ______build_____--> worker container1
                                                           |__-->worker container2
